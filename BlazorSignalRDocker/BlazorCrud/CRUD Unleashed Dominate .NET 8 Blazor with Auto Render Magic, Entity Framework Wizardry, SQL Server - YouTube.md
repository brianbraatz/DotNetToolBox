Thanks for the explanation, I've seen a lot of Blazor 8 videos, and yours is the best to describe auto render, just a comment, it would be nice to add some server-side components as well, in my case, I have a Blazor server app in net7, I want to updated to net 8 to use auto render but I have a couple components that need be to on the server because I use them to upload files (images of the products) and save them in a folder under the WWWROOT section, I couldn't find a solution to do that using web assembly
